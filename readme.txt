V. simple right now... clone this repo into ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/ComposerComplete.

Hopefully I'll get around to adding it to package control at some point.

The next thing I want to do is when one of these autocomplete suggestions are chose, I'd like to automatically insert a use statement at the head of the file.  Pull requests welcome!
